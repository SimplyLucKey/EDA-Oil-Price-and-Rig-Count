# Price-of-Oil
Analysis that looks into oil price and relationships with active drilling rigs while utilizing interactive plots and features. 

There are plenty of data on oil productions and price of oil in attempt to explain the oil price fluctuations. 
Instead of trying to predict oil prices, I'm going to look into how oil prices and number of active drilling rigs affect one another, if at all. 

Crude oil has to come from somewhere. Drilling rigs are an extremely good indication for how well an operator (oil company) is performing financially. 
The more rigs the operators have active, the more they plan to drill and produce, and vice versa. 
While there is no public sources on every major operator and their active rig count history, there is the active rig count dating back to 1975.

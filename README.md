There are tons of knowledge in the oil and gas industry that are unfamiliar to the general public. It is a niche industry. I have worked in this industry for 2+ years now, and I think case studies and analyses with information from the industry would be well suited in explaning certain behaviors and trends, as well as provide better information on how the industry operates. 

This is a case study that looks into oil price and relationships with active drilling rigs utilizing interactive plots and features. 

There are plenty of data on oil productions and price of oil in attempt to explain the oil price fluctuations. 
Instead of trying to predict oil prices, I'm going to look into how oil prices and number of active drilling rigs affect one another. Theoretically the number of active drill rigs should somewhat dictate the oil prices with a lag. The case study explores both variables and determines if the hypothesis is true, and if there is any relationships.

Crude oil has to come from somewhere. Drilling rigs are an extremely good indication for how well an operator (oil company) is performing financially. 
The more active rigs the operators have, the more they plan to drill and produce, and vice versa. 
While there is no public sources on every major operator and their active rig count history, there is the active rig count dating back to 1975.
